CSIT226/826 Human Computer Interaction Group Charter
Directions
Groups work better when members have a common understanding of the group’s goals and the ground rules for group activities. The purpose of this exercise is to help your group set some ground rules and goals.
Each member of your group will have some idea how the group should operate. This is the opportunity to share your thoughts so “simple misunderstandings” are less likely to arise in the future.
